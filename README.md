   - Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
   -     The requirements and goals of this app were to create an application that took in user information like a username, password, and a variety of items and amounts and store them in a database. The stored inventory created by the user must be able to be edited as well as giving the user the ability to add or remove inventory at will.
    
   - What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
   -     A login screen was necessary in order to keep user lists secure and only available to the single user. A main inventory screen was also needed for the bulk of what the app was designed for. A top action bar containing button did most of the functions of the application. The UI was simple and straightforward. No massive variations of colors and a dark mode available as well. 
    
   - How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
   -     I approached this app head on at first. Then after getting stuck over and over again I decided to take some time to look into the Android resources and absorb all of the information that I could. In the future this should be the first step to tackling a project.
    
   - How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
   -     Test small and test often. Every small change was tested while developing to prevent the out of control error spiral that can happen when you don't.
    
   - Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
   -     Setting up the database was the biggest challenge for me. Even unfinished, I feel like I did a huge amount of work just to create the database, let alone read or write to it.
    
   - In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
   -     I think the layout is the cleanest portion of my app. The theme editior provided by android was a big help in finding a color palette that worked.
